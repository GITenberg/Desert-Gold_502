description: A border town like Casita is no place for a drifter - especially a rich
  man's son looking for adventure. From the moment Dick Gale steps into the stinking,
  sun-baked hellhole of gambling and corruption, revolution, and revenge, he gets
  more than he bargained for. His old friend Thorne is in love with a beautiful Senorita
  who's been targeted by Mexican rebel Rojas. A bold, sneering devil of a man, feared,
  envied, and idolised by his people, Rojas spends gold like he spills blood - and
  collects women like trinkets. Gale knows that defying such a man could be suicide.
  Defeating him is his only chance to survive - in a brutal one-on-one battle on the
  parched desert cliffs.
